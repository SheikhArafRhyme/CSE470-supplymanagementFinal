Section: 5 (AFK/AKH miss)
this is the final project file of sprint 5
for earlier sprint i could not finish it in time so consider this as a final submission
This project was soully built on java swing and jFrame platform as multiple layers of user interface which will take input and show output in different forms and stuffs
it needs connection to the mySql and just does a lot of basic stuffs and mostly consists of button click and database link. so I made a dummy class including all the methods..
I could interprete from the project and it's functionalities to make some scenarios where different unit testing methods and procedures can be shown 
**** I do not have a mic in my pc , so i used google meet to record my screen and then use my mobile phones mic for the voice over***
